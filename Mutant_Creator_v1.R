# Author: Alban Ramette
# Description: Given one fasta sequence, creates multifasta files containing mutant fasta sequences
# allows only point mutations. See EMBOSS::msbar (not R) for more complex mutation schemes
# Explanations about filenames generated:
#   e.g. Fasta1_MR0.01_Nmut100.fasta means
# Fasta1 = original name 
# MR0.01 = mutation rate of 0.01 = 1% = (seqlength of 100 bases x 0.01 = 1 point mutation was introduced)
# Nmut100 = 100 mutated sequences. (the last number in each fasta header indicates the mutant id e.g. â€¦._1, â€¦C_2
# Warning message: 
# "Caution: Cannot create non-redundant mutants for Fasta1.txt and MR=0.01sequence= 622!!!"
# indicates that the algorthim could not find a unique mutant (the same mutants occur at least twice in this set)
# Change Ntries to make more search of unique sequences (may take more time then)
